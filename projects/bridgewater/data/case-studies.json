We seek to reach people in ways that they can actively participate and be a part of the future of the program. Through events like the “Energize Nova Scotia Discovery Fair”, people can be inspired and learn how they can be part of these solutions. Creating an atmosphere of continual learning for current and future generations is essential for Bridgewater to developing a clean energy economy."

With support from Efficiency Nova Scotia, they focused their spending on heating systems, appliances, lighting, and extra insulation – leading to a 75% reduction in their energy bills. That translates into nearly $5000 a year that is being reinvested into programming for the kids. By having support to take part in energy savings projects, community service providers can reinvest back into their community."

They signed up for the town’s Clean Energy Financing program, which gave them access to up to low interest financing to do energy upgrades to the home. About $9000 later, their home energy costs were reduced by nearly $2000 per year, and their home was more comfortable. Examples like this show how accessible programs can provide solutions to families who face energy stress"
