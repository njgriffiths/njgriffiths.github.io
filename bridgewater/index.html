In some cases the Town has already established programs or activities that support the pathway, but these need to be scaled up, whereas in other cases the activities are entirely new.</p><p>The modelling results indicate that deep emissions reductions are technically feasible, economically beneficial and logistically challenging, a finding that is both encouraging and inspiring.</p></div><div class="case-study" id="school"></div></section><section class="hero-wrap" id="hero-02"><div class="inner"><header class="title"><h1 class="secondary">Investments,</h1><h1 class="primary">Not Costs</h1></header></div></section><section id="investment" class="content"><div class="text-column"><h2 class="section-head">Financial Prosperity</h2><p>In Bridgewater, reducing greenhouse gas emissions saves money. All but two of the actions analysed result in financial savings, up to $6,000 per tonne of GHG emissions reduced. This is because the energy used in Bridgewater results in a lot of GHG emissions and there are many opportunities to save energy, particularly because of the number of older buildings.</p><p>Actions which generate both financial savings and GHG emissions reductions are no-loss opportunities. The implementation of these actions is likely currently constrained by legal, logistical or other barriers and strategies are required to overcome those barriers.</p></div><div class="media-wrap"><div class="media"><h4 class="chart-header">Clean Energy Capital Investments</h4> <img src="img/capital-investments.png" alt="Chart of clean energy capital investments"/></div></div><div class="text-column"><p>Achieving the energy and emissions reductions requires an investment in local infrastructure and equipment, unprecedented in scale for the community. Unlike costs, investments result in a financial return.</p><p>The highest investments are the result of the construction of major energy infrastructure, including district energy, wind and hydro. The decreasing capital investment in Strategy 3 is mainly due to reduced vehicle purchases as vehicle ownership rates decline with the advent of autonomous (self-driving) vehicles.</p></div><div class="text-column"><h2 class="section-head">End Energy Poverty</h2><p>More households in Atlantic Canada experience energy poverty than anywhere else in the country, and Bridgewater is no exception. A household is considered to be in a state of energy poverty if they are spending more than 10% of their monthly income on energy services. A household does not need to be low-income to experience energy poverty. Utility bills that spike in the winter can catch people unaware and make it difficult to budget. When a household is experiencing energy poverty, they may be forced to choose between paying utility bills, buying groceries, or purchasing medication.</p></div><div class="media-wrap"><div class="media"><h4 class="chart-header">Future Cost Savings</h4> <img src="img/energy-savings.png" alt="Chart of energy savings"/></div></div><div class="text-column"><p>By making the investments in the Energy Shift, the community will have access to cleaner, more efficient, more secure, and more affordable energy. Energy costs in 2050 are projected to be one quarter of a “business as usual” scenario at $56 million per year, including 2% inflation. In the Energy Shift scenario, the community can save over $2 billion in energy costs over 33 years, and GHG emissions will be 80% lower than they were in 2011.</p></div><div class="case-study" id="home"></div><div class="text-column"><h2 class="section-head">A Low Carbon Community</h2><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
